# ReadEasy
ReadEasy is our final submission for SB-Hacks.

## Inspiration

ReadEasy was inspired by the need to bridge the accessibility gap in digital documentation. Recognizing that many individuals struggle with standard document formats, especially those with visual impairments or dyslexia, we wanted to create a tool that makes reading and comprehending documents a more inclusive experience. Our goal was to harness AI technology to transform the way documents are accessed and understood by everyone.

## What it does

ReadEasy is an AI-powered Google Docs add-on that automatically reformats text, optimizes layouts, and ensures documents are screen-reader-friendly. It enhances readability by adjusting font sizes, applying high-contrast color schemes, and structuring content in a way that's easily navigable, particularly beneficial for users with dyslexia or those relying on screen readers.

## How we built it

We built ReadEasy using Google Apps Script, integrating it seamlessly with Google Docs. The core functionality leverages OpenAI's API algorithms for semantic analysis and natural language processing, enabling the add-on to intelligently reformat documents. We incorporated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the UI, ensuring it's intuitive and accessible.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the main challenges was ensuring the AI accurately interpreted and reformatted various document structures without altering the intended meaning and maintaining all links and images. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Creating a user-friendly interface that can be intuitively used by a diverse range of users stands as a testament to our commitment to inclusivity.

## What we learned

This project was a crash course in web development. We learned JavaScript, Google Apps Script, HTML, and CSS from scratch. Tackling a CSS framework for the first time was challenging but boosted our UI design efficiency. We now understand the basics of creating accessible web content and the importance of user-focused design.

## What's next for ReadEasy

Looking ahead, we plan to expand ReadEasy's capabilities to include more languages and incorporate feedback from users to refine its functionality. We aim to introduce features like automated summarization and personalized reading modes. Ultimately, we envision ReadEasy evolving into a comprehensive tool that sets a new standard for document accessibility.
